# use several patterns in N-layer architecture 

In this project I learned how to use N-layer architecture and divided it into 3 branches 
and each branch uses what is in the previous branch:

- main branch : I used generic respository. 
- unitofwork branch : I used generic repository + unitofwork. 
- CQRS branch : I used generic repository + unitofwork + CQRS pattern.
